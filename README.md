📝 Trading Classification Dashboard

# Overview
- The Trading Classification Dashboard is a machine learning project designed to classify the prevailing market sentiment (Fear, Greed, Neutral, etc.) by combining historical trade execution data with the Fear & Greed Index. The system builds a robust, end-to-end Scikit-learn Pipeline and deploys the resulting model as an interactive web application using Streamlit.


# Dataset
- The classification model relies on a merged dataset:
- Trade History = historical_data.csv (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fJYLpWqt123MbIblOjmHyuFDZFx-FQae/view?usp=sharing)
- Market Sentiment = fear_greed_index.csv (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ILczutp8NWAywtslZaTWy0cMEFzb95Li/view?usp=sharing)

# Data Preprocessing
- All preprocessing steps are encapsulated and automated within the final ML Pipeline:
- Data Integration: Trade data is merged with sentiment data on a normalized date column.
- Missing Value Imputation: Missing values in the sentiment classification and value are filled using the mode of the target column (predominantly 'Fear').
- Feature Transformation:
  - Numeric Features (Execution Price, Closed PnL, value, Fee): Standardized using StandardScaler.
  - Categorical Features (Account, Coin, Side, Direction, Crossed): Encoded using OneHotEncoder.

# Modeling (with Scikit-learn Pipeline)
